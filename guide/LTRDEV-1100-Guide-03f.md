## Guest Shell

TODO:

- [ ] @curtissmith Clean up Guest Shell introduction

A powerful software feature called Guest Shell has been brought to products running Cisco IOS XE.  Originally 
exclusively available on Nexus switching products running NX-OS, Guest Shell is now available on the Catalyst, ISR, 
and CSR product families.

Guest Shell is a virtualized Linux-based environment running on the network device, designed to run standard and custom 
Linux applications, including Python, for automated management of Cisco devices.  Guest Shell provides a secure 
environment, decoupled from the host network device, in which you can install and run scripts or software packages.

* Maintain IOS-XE system integrity
    * Isolated User Space
    * Fault Isolation
    * Resource Isolation
* On-box rapid prototyping
    * Device-level API Integration
    * Scripting (Python)
    * Linux Commands
* Application Hosting
* Integrate into your Linux workflow
* Integrated with IOS XE

Guest Shell is a decoupled execution space running within a Linux Container (LXC)

* From within the Guest Shell the network-admin has the following capabilities:
    * Access to the network over Linux network interfaces
    * Access to bootflash
    * AccesstoIOSCLI
    * The ability to install and run python scripts.
    * The ability to install and run 32-bit and 64-bit Linux applications.

### On-box vs. Off-box Network Programmability

So far in this lab, we have been focusing on so-called off-box network programmability.  That is to say, we've been 
running applications on a workstation and interfacing with network devices.  The applications reside on a workstation
and connect to a network device.  With on-box network programmability, we have the ability to host and run 
applications directly on the network device itself.

Off-Box network programmability is ideal for:

* configuration management and automation
* telemetry and operational data
* SDN controller functionality, e.g. Cisco DNA Center

On-Box network programmability is ideal for:

* network device provisioning automation
* IOS XE Embedded Event Manager (EEM) response automation
* edge compute for network applications and Internet of Things (IoT)

Guest Shell facilitates on-box network programmability, but with Application Hosting, Linux Containers (LXCs) can be 
installed for custom, purpose-built applications as well on network device platforms that support it.  This lab will 
focus on Guest Shell for script and utility hosting on IOS XE.

Here is a brief reference for the platforms that support Guest Shell today:

| Feature | Guest Shell 1.0 (Lite) | Guest Shell 1.0 | Guest Shell 2.1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Operating System | IOS XE 16.5.1a | IOS 16.5 | NX-OS 7.x |
| Platform | Catalyst 3650/3850 | Catalyst 9000, ISR 4000 | Nexus 3000, 9000 |
| Guest Shell Environment | MontaVista CGE7 | CentOS 7 | CentOS 7 |
| Python | v2.7 | v2.7, v3.0 | v2.7, v3.0 |
| RPM Install | No | Yes | Yes |
