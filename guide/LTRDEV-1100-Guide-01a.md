### Introducing Cisco DevNet

DevNet is your Network Programmability Dojo.  DevNet is where you can Learn, Code, Inspire, and Connect.  We'll 
explore what that means in the next step, but first, let's create a DevNet account.

#### Step 2: Exploring Cisco DevNet

DevNet is where you can Learn, Code, Inspire, and Connect.  It is the place to create and find inspiring applications,
learn about CiscoÂ APIs, and connect with other developers in Cisco communities.  DevNet is the single largest resource 
for everything "developer" at Cisco.  DevNet answers these questions:

* What is it and do I want to use it?
* How do I get started?
* How do I get access?
* How do I use it?
* How do I get help?
* How do I share inspiration?
