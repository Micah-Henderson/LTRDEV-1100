### Introducing APIs

### Importance of APIs

As discussed earlier in the introduction to Postman, APIs are a structured method of communicating with software. 
Information be queried (similar to a CLI `show` command on a router) or changed (think of `config t` on a router CLI)
in a programmatic way. Not only can commands be run through a script, but the information returned from an API is 
often structured in a way that allows for parsing of data. This allows for someone to code in logical steps to be 
taken depending on the returned values. In other words, API's are the key to allowing code to interact with 
software, devices, and other external components, amplifying the possibilities of what can be accomplished.
