The title of this lab is "So, You want to be a Network Programmability Ninja, Now What?"  In this lab, we will help 
you get started with network programmability and arm you with the concepts and tools and real-world use cases needed to 
make use of network programmability in your day-to-day work and play.

We will have fun with Ninja-themed metaphors: We will introduce you to the Network Programmability Dojo; teach you 
the Tools of the Ninja; allow you to Hone your Ninja Skills; and, finally, Test Your Ninja Skills with real-world use 
cases at the end of this lab.

We hope you have fun and learn valuable new skills!
