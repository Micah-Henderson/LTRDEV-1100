[Cisco Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/products/teams/index.html) (formerly Cisco Spark) is a platform for 
teamwork, communication, and collaboration. It allows individuals and teams to communicate via messaging, video 
meetings, whiteboarding, and more. On the surface, it has a lot of use and functionality; though with its 
well-developed API, it can become a favorite tool for network automation.

Using its API's, Webex Teams can act as a bidirectional human interfacing tool with network automation.  Webex teams 
supports the concept of 'bots' (automated users that provide some sort of interaction within the platform), which 
could be a way for network devices to communicate alerts, status changes, or other information. It could also provide
a way for a network operator to query a network device for interface statistics using human language. This level of 
extensibility brings much to the table for a network programmability ninja.
