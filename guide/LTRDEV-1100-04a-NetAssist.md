"ChatOps is a collaborative, conversation-centric way of working that brings people, discussions, bots, tools and 
files together in one central location: the workplace messaging app.[1] Instead of having to track down colleagues or
toggle between several platforms to find out what’s going on with their work and systems, ChatOps enables employees 
to clearly and quickly see what needs to be done at any given point in time. ChatOps aims to increase transparency 
and productivity while enhancing collaboration and employee engagement."
