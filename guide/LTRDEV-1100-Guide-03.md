### Introducing Model Driven Programmability

Model Driven Programmability...SNMP isn't good enough anymore...RFC-3535 and model driven programmability stack..
.Client/Server model...Transport Protocol/Data Model...NETCONF/YANG developed to address RFC-3535.

Traditional network device management techniques, for example command line interface (CLI) and web user interface 
(UI), were designed for human to machine interaction for configuring and accessing operational details.  They by 
definition are not programmable.  Although attempts at automation through screen scraping or imitating interactive 
sessions are possible, they are error prone, unrealiable, and do not scale.

The need for reliable and scalable ways to manage network devices is not a new one.  Simple Network Management Protocol 
(SNMP) was first introduced as a IETF Internet Standard in 1988 as a standard interface configure and retrieve 
operational information from network devices.  SNMP was revised over the years, chiefly to improve performance and 
security of the protocol.  However, SNMP still isn't adequate for the job today, relegated to polling statistics and 
status.

In 2003, the IETF published [RFC3535](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3535) *Overview of the 2002 IAB Network 
Management Workshop*, stating

> SNMP works reasonably well for device monitoring.

and found to be lacking in the following ways:

* Applications are necessary for SNMP to useful
* Lack of writeable MIBs in general and writeable MIBs for configuration more specifically
* Does not scale
* Too difficult to implement
* Lack of support for configuration retrieval or playback
* Mismatch between SNMP data-centric view of the world versus an operator's task-oriented view of the world 

"Model driven programmability inherits the power of models, making it easier to configure routers. It overcomes 
drawbacks posed by traditional router management techniques.

The solution lies in using data models â€“ a programmatic and standards-based way of writing configurations to any network device. Use it to replace the process of manual configuration and implement YANG as the de-facto data modeling language."
