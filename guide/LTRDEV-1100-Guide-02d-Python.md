## Python for Network Programmability

### Introducing Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a popular programming language and a great first language to learn. Python is 
highly readable, object oriented, and it can be run interactively through the Python interpreter. One reason that 
Python has become quite popular is due to its plethora of available modules, or reusable code, to tackle many different 
projects or tasks. Additionally, Python is available for many different operating systems, some of which even include 
it by default. This allows the same Python scripts to be written, modified, and executed by users on Windows, Mac, 
Linux, and more.

Learning a language like Python is really important on a journey towards network programmability. Python gives the 
flexibility to create reusable code to solve a particular problem, or perhaps automate a series of steps. Through its 
modules, Python can be used to communicate with networking devices in many ways, including SSH, NETCONF, 
and REST API's. With so many uses, it is one of the most powerful tools a Network Programmability Ninja can have.
