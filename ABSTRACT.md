# Agenda

The session will answer the questions: What is network programability?  How do you get started?  What Cisco products support network programmability? and more.  The session is targeted at engineers who have made the decision to embrace network programmability but aren't quite sure how to get started.  Participants will learn what are the foundational programming skills needed; workstation setup and tools needed; the protocols and data models used in Cisco products; and an introduction to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) through an interactive, hands-on session.  At the end of the session, participants will have completed a number of exercises that culminate with the programatic integration of multiple Cisco products, including IOS-XE and Cisco Spark. The session is not meant to be a Python programming tutorial.
